## Introduction and Purpose
This Rust project is made for Polkadot Substrate Development Bootcamp as second week homework to demonstrate very basic calculator using pattern matching, and Option and Result data types in Rust. Polkadot Substrate Development Bootcamp is organized by Patika.dev & Rise In.

## Some details
Enums are different in Rust, with respect to other programming language. (Rust is different entirely but efficient.) In Rust, assigning methods to elements of enum is possible. And created enum can be sent as argument to any custom functions in Rust. In relevant function, applied method can be checked via pattern matching. 

Another magical functionality of Rust is Option type. Rust doesn't want to deal with undefined value. Because of that, Option type is implemented. If return value is not proper programatically, by help of Option type, custom error messages can be printed rather than seeing crash of program.
